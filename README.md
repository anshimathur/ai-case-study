* **Founded:** 2016

* **Founder:** Pierre Barreau
    * ***Co-founders:*** Jean-Baptiste Pizzetti and Etienne Brunet

* The idea for this company came about when Pierre and the co-founders wanted to create a tool that could help the music generation process for producers, composers, and clients, especially within the film scores and game soundtracks fields. 

* Aiva was funded through both venture capital and angel investors. They had raised over 1.2 million Euros in 2020 (Silicon, 2020). 

## Business Activities

* Aiva aims to address the issue of slow, complex, and expensive music composition processes and allow users to have a cost effective and customizable way of generating high quality and creative music.

* Aiva's competitive advantage is in providing customers with a specialized music composition model. This model enhances emotional storytelling, fine-grained control, and diversity in genres, all within an open-source atmoshphere.

* The domain of AI music generation has evolved by combining creative arts with artificial intelligence. Key trends include the evolution of generative models and integration of AI with DAWs.
> * According to Medium, Aiva utilizes several advanced technologies on their platform which include "*Deep Learning and Neural Networks* like *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)* and *Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)*" most liklely implemented through *Python*. Aiva also generates music in sheet form or in MIDI. Their algorithim allows for high level customization and precision across genres and instruments. Their cloud-based platform also integrates with *Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs)* like Logic Pro or FL studio which delivers accesibility to the customers.

## Landscape

* Aiva is within the *AI-powered music generation* and *creative technologies* field.

* Over the past decade or so, Aiva has become sophisticated in creating high quality music. They are able to allow music personalization that resemble human creativity within music, film, video games, etc. They also have royalty-free music allowing users to create projects without licensing and copyright issues.

* Other major companies in the AI music creation field include:
  [MuseNet](https://openai.com/index/musenet), [Amper Music](https://www.ampermusic.com/) and [Soundraw](https://soundraw.io/).

## Results

* The business impact of Aiva has been their influence in democratizing music where AI can lead in music generation. This has been more heavily seen with content creation for those who seek high quality music who may not have the access to resources like profressional producers.

* Core metrics in this field include: 
     * **User growth and engagement:** number of active users, frequency of usage, time spent on platform
     * **Content quality:** ratings and reviews, music analysis, adoption rate
     * **Revenue growth:** total revenue
  
* Aiva's performance based on these metrics:
     * **User engagement:** growing user base
     * **Content quality:** high-quality and enhanced compositions
     * **Revenue growth:** Aiva operates on a freemium model generating revenue from premium        subscriptions
  
* Aiva has positioned themselves well within the AI music generation market. Their specialization in emotional composition, ease of use, and focus on rights management, differentiates them as a strong player in competition. Nonetheless, their competitors also provide unique and notable products and services, creating challenges (scalability, resources, etc.) in expansion and growth within this niched market share. 

## Recommendations

* A couple recommendations are if and when Aiva can offer *AI-Generated Vocal Synthesis* and *Lyric Creation* where users can also have AI vocals integrated into the songs across various genres.  

* This would demonstrate innovation, appeal to a broader audience, build a bigger reach, and increase large scale adoption resulting in higher revenue opportunities.

* The additional product would require *AI Vocal Synthesis* by utilizing *Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)* and *Neural Vocoder Models* to tailor compositions with human-like voices.

* These technologies are appropriate for the solutions as it will enable incorporation of human like speech, vocal patterns, and intonations. This would create more engagement and connection with the audience. Based on Aiva's success and its ability to adapt and integrate advanced AI technologies, Aiva would solidify its position with increased brand recognition and strengthen their reputation as a pioneer, making them a leader in the AI music generation industry.
