# AI CASE STUDY: AIVA

## Overview and Origin

* Company Name: Aiva

* Founded: 2016

* Founders: Pierre Barreau
  * Co-founders: Jean-Baptiste Pizzetti and Etienne Brunet

* The idea for this company came about when Pierre and the co-founders wanted to create a tool that could help the music generation process for producers and composers, especially for those who create for film scores, as well as game soundtracks. 

* Aiva was funded through both venture capital and angel investors. They had raised over 1.2 million Euros in 2020. 

## Business Activities

* Aiva aims to address the issue of slow and expensive music composition processes and allow users to have a cost effective and customizable way of generating high quality and creative music.

* The multiple industries that qualify as the intended customer for Aiva including: Film and Television, Video Game, Advertising, Content Creators, and Music Platforms. Of these industries, the most impacting in the marketspace include:
  *  Global Music (worth around 28.8 billion in 2022)
  *  Video Game (expected to reach approximately 300 billion in 2026)
  *  Advertising (reached 760 billion in 2022)

* Aiva's competitive advantage is in providing customers with a specialized music composition model. This model enhances emotional storytelling, fine-grained control, and diversity in genres, all within an open-source atmoshphere.

* Aiva utilizes several advanced technologies on their platform which include Deep Learning and Neural Networks like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) most liklely implemented through Python. Aiva also generates music in sheet form or in MIDI. Their algorithim allows for high level customization and precision across genres and instruments. Their cloud-based platform also integrates with digital audio workstations (DAWs) like Logic Pro or FL studio which delivers accesibility to the customers.

## Landscape

* Aiva is within the AI-powered music generation and creative technologies field.

* Over the past decade or so, Aiva has become sophisticated in creating high quality music. They are able to allow music personalization that miminic human creativity within music, film, video games, etc. They also have royalty-free music allowing users to create projects without licensing and copyright issues.

* Other major companies in the AI music creation field include Jukedeck, MuseNet, Amper Music and Sonantic.

## Results

* The business impact of Aiva has been their influence in democratizing music where AI can create music. This has been more heavily seen with content creation for those who seek high quality music who may not have the access to profressional producers.

* Some of the core metrics in this field include user growth, user engagement, and revenue growth.

* Aiva has positioned themselves well within the AI music generation market. Nonetheless, their competitors also provide unique and notable products and services, creating challenges in expansion and growth within this niched market share. Therefore, it is not a monopolized space, rather becoming a perfect competition.

## Recommendations

* One recommendation is if and when Aiva can offer AI-Generated Vocal Synthesis and  Lyric Creation where users can also have AI vocals integrated into the songs across various genres.  

* This would appeal to a broader audience, build a bigger reach, and increase large scale adoption resulting in higher revenue opportunities.

* The additional product would require AI Vocal Synthesis by utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Neural Vocoder Models to tailor compositions with human-like voices.

* These technologies are appropriate for the solutions as it will enable incorporation of human like speech, vocal patterns, and intonations. This could have more engagement and connection with the audience.
